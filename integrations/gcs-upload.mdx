## Overview

GameRamp provides a secure Google Cloud Storage bucket where you can upload your game data files for processing. This integration works from any platform including AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premises systems.

**Bucket Name:** `gc-third-party-uploads`

## Getting Started

Contact the GameRamp team at [connect@gameramp.com](mailto:connect@gameramp.com) to receive your service account credentials with upload access to your designated folder.

## Upload Approaches

### Approach 1: Using Google Cloud CLI (Recommended)

**Best for:** Regular uploads, automated scripts, GCP environments

```bash
# Install Google Cloud SDK
# macOS: brew install google-cloud-sdk
# Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk

# Authenticate with your service account key
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=path/to/your-service-account-key.json

# Upload files
gsutil cp your-data-file.csv gs://gc-third-party-uploads/your-client-folder/
gsutil cp *.csv gs://gc-third-party-uploads/your-client-folder/
```

### Approach 2: AWS Native Approach

**Best for:** AWS environments, existing AWS CLI workflows

```bash
# Install Google Cloud SDK on AWS EC2 or local AWS environment
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
exec -l $SHELL

# Authenticate with provided service account key
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=path/to/your-service-account-key.json

# Upload from AWS environment
gsutil cp your-data-file.csv gs://gc-third-party-uploads/your-client-folder/

# Or sync entire directories
gsutil -m rsync -r ./data/ gs://gc-third-party-uploads/your-client-folder/
```

### Approach 3: Programmatic Integration

**Best for:** Application integration, automated data pipelines

**Python Example:**
```python
from google.cloud import storage
import os

# Set credentials
os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = 'path/to/your-key.json'

# Upload function
client = storage.Client()
bucket = client.bucket('gc-third-party-uploads')

def upload_file(source_path, destination_name):
    blob = bucket.blob(f"your-client-folder/{destination_name}")
    blob.upload_from_filename(source_path)
    print(f"Uploaded {source_path} to {destination_name}")

upload_file('player_events.csv', 'events_2024_12_03.csv')
```
